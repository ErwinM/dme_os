------
allocating memory will also mean allocatng a page (since the available memory is bigger than the address space)

VM
--
building a new address space is done by:
- reserving one of the 16 (512/32) address spaces (OS)
- this address space is identified by its PTB
- mapping kernel code
- get page for process kernel stack
- map process kernel stack

user space part:
- allocate x pages
- map them
- copy in code


To implement on hardware:
-------------------------
- pop.u
- wcr.u / lcr.u
- can syscall store its argument in sR2 easily?


process life cycle:
-------------------
P(fork) -> C(exec) -> C(runs program) -> C(calls exit = state: zombie) -> P(wait cleans up)
