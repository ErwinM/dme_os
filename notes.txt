- i/o space should bypass paging logic or it should be above 512kb. The last option would be cleanest and allow it to be remapped. Current setup I have actually created the shitty mem mapped io like on x86 lol
-> lets map one page above 512kb. we can use bit20 to identify i/o space
-> we need to adjust PTE to have fewer status bits (5?)

or doenst it.....what if in every address space page[31] -> page[31]..
nope i dont!!!
